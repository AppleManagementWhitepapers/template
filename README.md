# Reasoning and methodology behind how each document is made 

I originally needed to convice the security team at my employer to evaluate and approve the use of several open source products that are the current gold standard of Mac Management. I therefore wrote security 'whitepapers' like brief, to-the-point marketing-style material to be in line with other whitepapers I've reviewed from vendors. They commonly point to regulations that industries need to pay attention to, or are in line with common hardening standards for (buzzword buzzword) general security posture. Here are links to some of the vendor materials I've modeled mine after, along with the standards documents I consulted:

## Vendor Examples
https://puppet.com/resources/white-paper/maximizing-it-security-configuration-management
(Puppet~labs~ now puts all of their docs and downloads behind logins because reasons)
[Docker Security Intro](https://d3oypxn00j2a10.cloudfront.net/assets/img/Docker%20Security/WP_Intro_to_container_security_03.20.2015.pdf)
(In case that link breaks their security resources page is [here](http://www.docker.com/docker-security))

## Standards Documents
[PCI (Credit Card Company) Data Security Standards](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss)
(Behind approval legalese, but at least there's no signup)
[The 'Security Rule' Document that Codifies HIPAA Regulations](http://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/securityrule/securityrulepdf.pdf)
(Pertinent stuff is, I kid you not, from page 8341, including sections 164.308 and 164.312)
[Federal hardening guidelines](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-53r4.pdf)
